# Unit5-Work-Day-Scheduler

### Description 

This project involved using a lot of third-party API's like Jquery, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome to construct the Work Day Scheduler.  The time clock comes from JQuery moment.js site to give the user the current time for the Scheduler.  We used the property time block to establish present, past, and future for the application.
