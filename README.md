# Unit5-Work-Day-Scheduler

### Description 

This project involved using a lot of third-party API's like Jquery, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome to construct the Work Day Scheduler.  The project involved making a dynamic and responsive site with Javascript and Jquery as well with a css stylesheet. The time clock comes from JQuery moment.js site to give the user the current time for the Scheduler.  Time blocks were used to show what tasks are - present, past, and future in the application by using colors for each.  The save button gives the ability to save these items.  The saved events persist in local storage.
